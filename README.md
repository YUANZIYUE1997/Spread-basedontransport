# Spread-basedontransport
This is my first project named as the epidemic spreading based on transport data AKA Spread_basedontransport (for short SPREAD).
How to Submit Experimental Data 
Experimental and Modeling Results will be submitted, stored, and made publicly available on the Spread-basedontransport GitHub Repository. Experimental data may be shared by submitting pull requests to this repository or by sending data via email to [Miss YUAN ZIYUE] (ziyue.yuan@connect.polyu.hk). 

File Format 
Experimental and Model results should be organized in  python file (*.py), CSV UTF-8(Comma delimited) files(*.csv), Excel Workbook (*.xlsx or *.xls) or Text (Tab delimited) (*.txt). with clear header names: For all data, please label the origin webpage and source. Examples of how to format data submissions, which may be used as templates, are included [here] which belongs to csv file. (https://github.com/YUANZIYUE1997/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports). 

File Naming 
For simplicity, please collect your files in a single folder with your PROJECT name [PROJECT]. Please save source codes and analysis results with a name indicating your PROJECT, the TRAVEL MODE or RESOURCE and the FUNCTION for the research, for example: SPREAD_train station_passenger.csv. There is an example for source code named SPREAD_SoGou_agentdata.py.(https://github.com/YUANZIYUE1997/Spread-basedontransport/blob/master/SPREAD_SoGou_agentdata.py).

File Organization 
Data from repeated analyses should be saved and submitted as separate files, numbered sequentially with project name (e.g.,SPREAD_train station_passenger_PROJECT01.csv and SPREAD_train station_passenger_PROJECT02.csv).Please avoid this situation. 

File Description 
Please also include a separate README file (.txt or .docx) that provides a description of the OBJECTIVE, DATA DESCRIPTION and FINAL RESULT of all data groups (like Agentdata from different resources or locations). Please define the file name as the name of its data group name(like AGENTDATA).

THANKS VERY MUCH AND LETS DO IT!
